# Global Terraform code

Stacks allows you to define global Terraform code that's shared across all stacks.

This can be used for use cases like defining a common Terraform state backend template (see [this](<3.2.1. Terraform state backend configuration.md>)), or iterating through a list of regions to define multiple instances of the same provider (see [this](<3.2.2. Terraform provider generation.md>)).

Global Terraform code must be located in the stacks directory like this:
```
|-- environments/
`-- stacks/
   |-- ...
   `-- global.tf   # here
```
Any files named `*.tf` will work.
