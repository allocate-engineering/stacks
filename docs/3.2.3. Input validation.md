# Input validation

One interesting thing Stacks does with Jinja is inject a `throw(msg)` filter which performs a Python `raise Exception(msg)`.
This allows halting the execution of a Stacks render if the template is programmed to do so.

We can use this for input validation, for example.

## Example: enforcing an `owner` variable be defined out of a list of valid values

```hcl
# stacks/owners.tf
{% if 'owner' in var %}{{ throw('var.owner is not defined') }}{% endif %}
{% if var.owner not in var.owners %}{{ throw('var.owner not in var.owners') }}{% endif %}
```

```hcl
# stacks/owners.tfvars
owners = [
  "engineering",
  "marketing",
  "operations",
  "sales",
]
```

From now on, on each stack/layer, you'll have to define a valid owner:
```hcl
owner = "engineering"
```
Otherwise Stacks will fail to render.

This can be used for enforcing common resource tagging policies, for ownership tracking, cost analysis, etc.
