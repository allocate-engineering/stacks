# Jinja templating for variables

Similar to how you get Jinja for templating Terraform code, you also get Jinja support to define variables themselves.

You can do so by creating any number of `*.tfvars.jinja` files where you would normally have `*.tfvars` files.
These get rendered using the variables defined in the non-Jinja counterparts, and they get higher override priority than them, of course.

Here's where you can use Jinja in variables:
```
|-- environments/
|   `-- production/
|       `-- env.tfvars                 # not here
`-- stacks/
   |-- ec2/
   |   |-- base/
   |   |-- layers/
   |   |   `-- production/
   |   |       |-- layer.tfvars        # not here
   |   |       `-- layer.tfvars.jinja  # here
   |   |-- stack.tfvars                # not here
   |   `-- stack.tfvars.jinja          # here
   |-- globals.tfvars                  # not here
   `-- globals.tfvars.jinja            # here
```

Be careful not to put yourself in a cyclical dependency, however.
