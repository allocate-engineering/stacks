# Inline secret encryption

Similar to [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops), [eyaml](https://github.com/voxpupuli/hiera-eyaml) or [Kubernetes sealed secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets), Stacks gives you the ability to write down encrypted secrets directly in your configuration.

## Encrypting a secret

First, if you don't have a public key already, generate a key pair as described in the last section of this document.

Then use your public key to encrypt the secret:
```shell
$ stacks encrypt --public-key-path path/to/public.pem -- 'mysecr3t'  # the "--" before your secret is only required if your secret begins with "--", so Stacks doesn't parse it as a non-existent flag, but it doesn't hurt to always use it
ENC[l42kj562...v349120j]
```
The `ENC[l4...0j]` output is your encrypted secret.

Finally, copy your encrypted secret anywhere you wish to use it:
```hcl
# environments/production/env.tfvars
aws_secret_access_key = "ENC[l42kj562...v349120j]"
```

***Note:** only string values can be encrypted, and they must be fed to Stacks via `*.tfvars` variables (i.e. you cannot use them directly in resource attributes).*

## Using an encrypted secret

To use your encrypted secrets, all you need to do is set the `STACKS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` environment variable to point to your private key, and then run Stacks normally.

***Note:** this implies you can only use one key pair to encrypt/decrypt all the secrets of your running layer.*

## Decrypting a secret

Here's how you can consult the value of an encrypted secret (you'll need your private key):
```shell
$ stacks decrypt --private-key-path path/to/private.pem 'ENC[l42kj562...v349120j]'
mysecr3t
```
The `mysecr3t` output is your decrypted secret.

## Generating a new key pair

1. Run `stacks genkey --public-key-path public.pem --private-key-path private.pem`.
2. Store `private.pem` in a safe place. Make sure to exclude it from version control!
