# Installation instructions

## 1. Install Python

Stacks is written in Python, so it'll need a working [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) interpreter on your machine.

We recommend the version specified in [pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml).

## 2. Install `pip` or `uv`

Stacks is installable with both [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

Choose one and install it. If you already have `pip` installed you can skip `uv`, otherwise we recommend the latter.

## 3. Install Terraform

Stacks requires [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) (or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/)) to be installed on your machine.

Stacks will use the binary in the `STACKS_TERRAFORM_PATH` environment variable, which defaults to `terraform` (so it'll look up `terraform` in `$PATH` and use that).

If you use OpenTofu make sure to set `STACKS_TERRAFORM_PATH` to `tofu`.

If `STACKS_TERRAFORM_PATH` is not in `$PATH`, you can also set `STACKS_TERRAFORM_PATH` to the absolute path of the binary you want to use (e.g.: `STACKS_TERRAFORM_PATH=/usr/bin/terraform`).

## 4. Install Stacks

To install Stacks using `pip`:
```shell
pip3 install --break-system-packages git+https://github.com/cisco-open/stacks.git
```

To install Stacks using `uv`:
```shell
uv tool install git+https://github.com/cisco-open/stacks.git
```

For development, we recommend you install Stacks from source:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:cisco-open/stacks.git
cd stacks/
uv tool install --editable .
```
The `--editable` flag allows you to try your changes right away without reinstalling `stacks`.
