# "I am collaborating to Stacks itself" quick-start guide

We assume you have followed Stacks' [installation instructions](<2.1. Installation instructions.md>).
Make sure you install Stacks from source so you can develop comfortably, though.

We're open to contributions but are very strict on the project's direction, so make sure you align with us before any significant development efforts.
You can contact us by raising an issue on our GitHub repository.

Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
