# "I am collaborating to an existing stack" quick-start guide

We assume you have followed Stacks' [installation instructions](<2.1. Installation instructions.md>).

All stacks have the following structure:
```
|-- environments/
`-- stacks/
   `-- vpc/
       |-- base/
       |   |-- backend.tf
       |   `-- main.tf
       |-- layers/
       |   |-- development/
       |   |   `-- layer.tfvars
       |   `-- production/
       |       `-- layer.tfvars
       `-- stack.tfvars
```

Here's what you need to know:
- `vpc` is the stack name.
- `base` is where the stack's Terraform root module is located.
- Variables in the stack's `*.tfvars` files are injected on all layers.
- Variables in the layers' `*.tfvars` files override those of the stack's `*.tfvars` files.

With that in mind:
- If you want to **modify the infrastructure in all layers**, change the stack's base to your liking.
- If you want to **modify the infrastructure in one or a subset of layers**, change the stack's base to support different templating based on a common variable with different value between layers on one side and the other.
- If you want to **modify the variable values of all layers**, change the stack's `*.tfvars` files` (make sure they aren't being overriden at the layer level).
- If you want to **modify the variable value of one or a subset of layers**, change the layers' `*.tfvars` files.
