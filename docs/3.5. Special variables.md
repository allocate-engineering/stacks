# Special variables

Along with any variables you may define, Stacks also injects a number of read-only variables for you to use in Jinja and/or Terraform.

Here's a full list of all special variables:

## `var.stacks_path`
The path of the current running layer, relative to the stacks directory parent.
Example: `stacks/vpc/layers/production`.

## `var.stacks_root`
The path of the stacks directory parent, relative to Terraform's runtime working directory.
Similar to Terraform's `${path.root}`, so you can reference other files relative to the root of the repository.
Example: `../../../../..`.

## `var.stacks_stack`
The name of the stack.
Example: `vpc`.

## `var.stacks_layer`
The full (directory) name of the layer.
Example: `production@us-east-1_foo`.

## `var.stacks_environment`
The name of the environment.
Example: `production`.

## `var.stacks_subenvironment`
The name of the subenvironment, if applicable, otherwise it's `""` (empty string).
Example: `us-east-1`.

## `var.stacks_instance`
The name of the instance, if applicable, otherwise it's `""` (empty string).
Example: `foo`.

## `var.stacks_environments`
A map of all environments and their settings.
Example:
```
{
	production = {
		production      = true
		aws_region      = "eu-south-2"
		aws_assume_role = "Admin"
	}
	development = {
		production      = false
		aws_region      = "eu-south-2"
		aws_assume_role = "Developer"
	}
}
```
