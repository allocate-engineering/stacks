# `stacks diff`

## Usage
```
Usage: stacks diff [OPTIONS]

  Render and compare Git HEAD vs current uncommitted changes.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

## Description

***Note:** assumes your Terraform code uses Git for version control.*

Runs `stacks render` on both Git `HEAD` (without uncommited changes) and your current working directory (including uncommitted changes).
Then diff's both output codes.

Useful when debugging Stacks Jinja templating.

Uses `git stash` to temporarily store your uncommitted changes.
If it crashes it might've not cleaned up successfully so you'll need to `git stash pop` yourself.

Must run within a layer directory (e.g. `stacks/vpc/layers/production`).

## Example

```shell
$ cd stacks/vpc/layers/production
$ stacks diff
```
